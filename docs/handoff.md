# Developer handoff

Updated 9 October 2026 with installation, configuration and troubleshooting guides for release `v1.2.0`. Current behavior includes listing search, conservative duplicate grouping and the verified Oracle deployment. `v1.0.0` remains the original baseline. The extended check is documented in [its implementation report](extended-rdw-check.md). Use `git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all` for exact versions. `origin` points to GitHub, with history and release tags pushed. Production deployment is enabled and verified; see [deployment](deployment.md) for the current separate-proxy topology.

## First session

Oracle release `6492d2ab1293dd6ebfc15886fb3f4f823b0736a2` was deployed successfully on 8 October through [workflow 37784839170](https://github.com/twanterstappen/ritvizier/actions/runs/37784839170). The app is on `oracle-portfolio` at `158.178.148.105`; the separate reverse proxy is `144.21.43.210` and targets the frontend on port 3000. See [current topology](deployment.md#current-oracle-topology). All three app containers were healthy, HTTPS home/search pages responded, and a live RDW lookup wrote a PostgreSQL cache record. For later rollouts, check the main workflow and VPS `current-release` file rather than assuming this revision is still current. No listing feed is connected yet.

Read [Agent instructions](../AGENTS.md), [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md), [Architecture](architecture.md) and [Verification](verification.md). Inspect the branch, working tree and history. Start the next task from `main` on a new branch. Follow [Installation](install.md) with the normal API on port 8000 and frontend on port 3000. [Configuration](configuration.md) explains native/container settings; [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) covers common failures.

## Current behavior

The page shell uses a full-height flex layout, with the footer followed by sticky mobile navigation in document flow. It no longer reserves a separate fixed-navigation padding gap. Plate clear controls have inset touch targets. Vehicle comparison uses a semantic table with aligned values and a contained horizontal scroller for three cars. Non-import registration age is not applicable. Browser icons use the current R mark through a fresh SVG URL and ICO fallback. See [layout verification](verification.md#mobile-layout-and-comparison-polish-9-october-2026).

The homepage pairs a license-plate search with a generated Dutch-road car photograph, short summaries and links to comparison and costs. A soft fade keeps the search readable in light and dark themes; phones show the photo below the form. A custom road-and-lens logo appears in the navigation, favicon, app icons and share artwork. Vehicle-page illustrations, eyebrow headings, repeated calls to action and slogans have been removed. Direct page titles and shorter empty states preserve the existing workflows. See [the interface verification](verification.md#interface-simplification-9-october-2026) for local setup and browser evidence.

The new `/aanbod` page and `Vergelijkbaar aanbod` vehicle tab search authorized Dutch listing snapshots and group duplicates with all source links retained. `LISTINGS_FILE` is unset by default, so live listings are unavailable until a current free export is connected. No JP.cars or paid API is used. See [listing search](listing-search.md) for CSV/JSON imports, required fields, conservative identity rules and operational limits.

- Dutch plate lookup and direct `/auto/{formatted-plate}` links.
- Vehicle sections for overview, APK/registration, odometer/history, recalls, execution, engine, emissions, dimensions, costs and practical information.
- Both colors, execution identifiers, exact transmission where available, separate WLTP/NEDC data and source links.
- Per-plate recalls with defects, risks, remedy and producer-reported repair status.
- Automatic provincial road tax, editable monthly/yearly running costs and manual tax override.
- Local recent/saved/comparison collections, persistent theme and mobile navigation.
- Short content transitions with reduced-motion support. Registration year is `2026`, without a thousands separator.
- Actual APK notification/defect timeline with date-valid official descriptions, observed counts and repeated-category warnings.
- All fuel/body records, body specifications, class records and expanded optional axle details. Optional manual mileage gives a labeled annual average.
- Structured section provenance, per-source caching and pure analysis. Possible model recalls remain separate from exact plate actions.

## Regression vehicle

G921GS is a MINI Countryman Cooper used for live checks and fixture snapshots. The 6 October 2026 snapshot has Groen/Zwart, FMX/YW31/DAW500L0, automatic transmission with 7 gears, odometer judgment Logisch with registration year 2026, and no pending recall indicator or linked public campaign.

Consumption is 6.9 l/100 km WLTP and 5.4 NEDC; CO2 is 157 g/km WLTP and 122 NEDC; massa rijklaar is 1,490 kg. Reviewed 2026 tax is EUR 226 per quarter in Noord-Holland and EUR 247 in Zuid-Holland. These are fixture expectations, not a promise that live data cannot change.

Raw sources are in `backend/tests/fixtures/rdw-mini.json`, normalized browser records in `backend/tests/fixtures/vehicles.json`. Synthetic recalls exist only in tests. Production must keep using the real provider.

The 7 October extension adds actual APK notifications for 15 October 2025 and 13 October 2023. The 2023 event has one wheel-bearing observation and two brake-hose observations. Five possible model campaigns are shown as context, without changing the false plate indicator. This is a subset of public history, not a current condition assessment.

| Before January 2027                       | Review/update tax tariffs. The snapshot expires after December 2026 and returns unavailable beyond validity. Follow the updater instructions and compare with the official calculator.                    |
| Before accepting production contributions | Configure GitHub branch protection with required CI. The remote and history/tags are already backed up.                                                                                                   |
| Before scaling public traffic             | Review the shared proxy-IP rate bucket, trusted proxy handling and capacity. HTTPS and production deployment were verified on 8 October.                                                                  |
| For each production rollout               | Check the deploy job, host release file and container health. Persistent cache writes were verified on 8 October; database restore, certificate renewal and real failed-release recovery remain untested. |

## Known limits

The used public sources do not supply exact mileage, full inspection/maintenance or damage history, previous owner identities/counts or every commercial option package. Theft/road-ban status currently points to the official RDW check. General model recalls do not prove this plate has an open action. Exact approval data needs an unambiguous match.

Source schema 3 is current. Use the allowlisted `rdw_client.py` rather than introducing another HTTP client. Defect-reference data is cached for seven days and descriptions join by code plus date validity. Keep note-only defect events distinct from confirmed notifications. Check `source.partial` and section fetch dates when debugging. The optional valuation provider contract has no actual market-data provider or public endpoint.

Tax covers supported passenger-car cases, excluding personal exemptions and suspension. Costs omit depreciation, finance and purchase price. The install manifest exists; a service worker and offline data caching do not. Chromium/WebKit tests are not physical-device Safari tests. The public site is `https://ritvizier.nl`; listing coverage remains unavailable without a feed.

## Troubleshooting

Use [the troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md) for diagnostic commands and recovery steps. The quick reference below points to the most common checks.

| Symptom                        | First check                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LAN plate input stays disabled | Restart dev server after IPv4 changes, check development origins and run `node scripts/check-lan.mjs http://<local-ip>:3000`. Keep hydration safeguards. |
| Lookup fails                   | Check `/health`, server-only `BACKEND_URL` and logs. Process health does not establish RDW reachability.                                                 |
| New RDW field stays missing    | Check source warnings, exact joins and cache freshness. Normal data caches six hours; warnings retry within 60 seconds.                                  |
| Browser tests cannot start     | Free 3100/8001, install engines and build first. Use the repository Python environment.                                                                  |
| Filtered tests find nothing    | Use the direct Playwright command in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; nested npm/PowerShell forwarding can lose `--grep`.                                              |
| Tax unavailable                | Check province, tariff date, category/weight and required diesel/LPG choices. Never substitute zero.                                                     |
| Old saved record disappears    | Check Zod defaults and the legacy-storage regression test.                                                                                               |

Update this handoff when behavior or operations change. Record dated evidence in `verification.md`.

On the current machine, the frontend's ignored environment points to a dedicated API at `127.0.0.1:8002`, with reload enabled. The older port-8000 process was left intact after automatic review blocked its termination. Fresh setup still uses the README's port 8000. Inspect `BACKEND_URL` instead of assuming a port when validating the running app.
